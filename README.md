# Slots
This is a collection of slots-related simulations (initially in Python3, but who knows how we'll evolve) which either (a) track the expected outcome of a variety of slots games, or (b) allows the user to emulate the play of such games. As of its initial release, the code focuses mostly on (a); (b) is forthcoming (as of 21 Jun 2022).

## Changelog
### 21 Jun 2022
1. Initial commit of Crazy 8's and "Blanks and Scatters" analyses. User-driven playthroughs will be added directly.
